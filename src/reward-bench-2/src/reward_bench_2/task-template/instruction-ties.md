### Task Description
Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of each of the {n} responses provided by an
AI assistant to the user query displayed below. Rate every response separately, on its own merits.

Notes:
1- Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, and accuracy of the response, but need not consider depth or level of detail of the response.
2- Be as objective as possible. Rate each response on a scale of 1 to 10. For each rating, only give a whole number between 1 and 10 (inclusive).

[Query]
{query}

{responses}

Save your ratings to the file `/workspace/ratings.json` as one JSON object that maps each response number to its rating, for example `{"1": 7, "2": 3}`. Rate all {n} responses. Only the contents of that file are graded.
